# Elm File 

Elm File is a library that provides a solid set of rails for uploading and downloading files with Elm.

### Current state

* A flexible way for you to implement file uploads within your elm application
* Forces you fill-in-the-blanks with upload strategies
* Packaged with components that I hope should speed up your development process
